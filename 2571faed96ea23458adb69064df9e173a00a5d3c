  Bug: A buffer overrun condition exists in the SMB/CIFS packet fragment
  re-assembly code in smbd which would allow an attacker to cause smbd to
  overwrite arbitrary areas of memory in its own process address space. This
  could allow a skilled attacker to inject binary specific exploit code into
  smbd.
